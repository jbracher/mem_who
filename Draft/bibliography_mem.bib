  abstract = {Background
Establishing influenza thresholds and transmission intensity can help evaluate seasonal changes in influenza severity and potential pandemics. We aimed to evaluate the moving epidemic method (MEM) for calculating influenza thresholds for season 2016/17 in Egypt using four parameters, to identify the most useful parameter. Also to measure the agreement between both the country-specific statistical empirical method and World Health Organization method to MEM for determining the length and intensity level of activity of the influenza season.
Methods
Routinely epidemiological and laboratory data from sentinel surveillance sites for Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) were used for calculating thresholds for seasons between 2010/11 and 2015/16 to test 2016/17 season. The parameters calculated were: screened ILI consultation rate × 1000, screened ILI composite parameter, influenza positivity percentage among sampled SARI cases, and influenza positivity percentage among sampled ILI and SARI cases. These parameters assess seasonality and intensity of influenza activity using the three proposed methods (mentioned above). Agreement between the three methods was done using several approaches.
Results
The intensity of influenza activity by MEM was lower than the other two methods. Agreement between MEM and each of the other two techniques varied appreciably from good to very good for seasonal duration, and poor to fair for intensity level. In addition, parameters including laboratory data showed a pattern of bi-wave activity; the first wave occurred in winter mostly between epidemiological weeks 39 and 52 and the second occurred in spring mostly between weeks 12 and 17.
Conclusion
Parameters including laboratory data were more useful in defining seasonality of influenza. Further exploration of the MEM model in future seasons may help to provide a more comprehensive understanding of its use and application.},

We used the moving epidemic method to develop intensity thresholds (ITs) for 3 US surveillance indicators from the 2003–2004 through 2014–2015 influenza seasons (excluding the 2009 pandemic). The indicators were: 1) outpatient visits for influenza-like illness; 2) influenza-related hospitalizations; and 3) influenza- and pneumonia-related deaths. ITs were developed for the population overall and separately for children, adults, and older adults, and they were set at the upper limit of the 50\\% (IT50), 90\\% (IT90), and 98\\% (IT98) 1-sided confidence intervals of the geometric mean of each season’s 3 highest values. Severity was classified as low if ≥2 systems peaked below IT50, moderate if ≥2 peaked between IT50 and IT90, high if ≥2 peaked between IT90 and IT98, and very high if ≥2 peaked above IT98. We pilot-tested this method with the 2015–2016 season and the 2009 pandemic. Overall, 4 seasons were classified as low severity, 7 as moderate, 2 as high, and none as very high. Among the age groups, older adults had the most seasons (n = 3) classified as high, and children were the only group to have seasons (n = 2) classified as very high. We will apply this method to classify the severity of future seasons and inform pandemic response.}},

  abstract = {Abstract Background Defining the start and assessing the intensity of influenza seasons are essential to ensure timely preventive and control measures and to contribute to the pandemic preparedness. The present study aimed to determine the epidemic and intensity thresholds of influenza season in Tunisia using the moving epidemic method. Methods We applied the moving epidemic method (MEM) using the R Language implementation (package “mem”). We have calculated the epidemic and the different intensity thresholds from historical data of the past nine influenza seasons (2009-2010 to 2017-2018) and assessed the impact of the 2009-2010 pandemic year. Data used were the weekly influenza-like illness (ILI) proportions compared with all outpatient acute consultations. The goodness of the model was assessed using a cross validation procedure. Results The average duration of influenza epidemic during a typical season was 20 weeks and ranged from 11 weeks (2009-2010 season) to 23 weeks (2015-2016 season). The epidemic threshold with the exclusion of the pandemic season was 6.25\%. It had a very high sensitivity of 85\% and a high specificity of 69\%. The different levels of intensity were established as follows: low, if ILI proportion is below 9.74\%, medium below 12.05\%; high below 13.27\%; and very high above this last rate. Conclusions This is the first mathematically based study of seasonal threshold of influenza in Tunisia. As in other studies in different countries, the model has shown both good specificity and sensitivity, which allows timely and accurate detection of the start of influenza seasons. The findings will contribute to the development of more efficient measures for influenza prevention and control.},

Objectives  (i) To calculate the epidemic threshold for influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infections (ARI) in 19 countries, as well as the thresholds for different levels of intensity. (ii) To evaluate the performance of these thresholds. Methods  The moving epidemic method (MEM) has been developed to determine the baseline influenza activity and an epidemic threshold. False alerts, detection lags and timeliness of the detection of epidemics were calculated. The performance was evaluated using a cross-validation procedure. Results  The overall sensitivity of the MEM threshold was 71·8\% and the specificity was 95·5\%. The median of the timeliness was 1 week (range: 0–4·5). Conclusions  The method produced a robust and specific signal to detect influenza epidemics. The good balance between the sensitivity and specificity of the epidemic threshold to detect seasonal epidemics and avoid false alerts has advantages for public health purposes. This method may serve as standard to define the start of the annual influenza epidemic in countries in Europe.},

  abstract = {Objectives Although influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) surveillance are well established in Europe, the comparability of intensity among countries and seasons remains an unresolved challenge. The objective is to compare the intensity of ILI and ARI in some European countries. Design and setting Weekly ILI and ARI incidence rates and proportion of primary care consultations were modeled in 28 countries for the 1996/1997–2013/2014 seasons using the moving epidemic method (MEM). We calculated the epidemic threshold and three intensity thresholds, which delimit five intensity levels: baseline, low, medium, high, and very high. The intensity of 2013/2014 season is described and compared by country. Results The lowest ILI epidemic thresholds appeared in Sweden and Estonia (below 10 cases per 100 000) and the highest in Belgium, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Serbia, and Slovakia (above 100 per 100 000). The 2009/2010 season was the most intense, with 35\% of the countries showing high or very high intensity levels. The European epidemic period in season 2013/2014 started in January 2014 in Spain, Poland, and Greece. The intensity was between low and medium and only Greece reached the high intensity level, in weeks 7 to 9/2014. Some countries remained at the baseline level throughout the entire surveillance period. Conclusions Epidemic and intensity thresholds varied by country. Influenza-like illnesses and ARI levels normalized by MEM in 2013/2014 showed that the intensity of the season in Europe was between low and medium in most of the countries. Comparing intensity among seasons or countries is essential for understanding patterns in seasonal epidemics. An automated standardized model for comparison should be implemented at national and international levels.},

  abstract  = {Influenza surveillance is critical to monitoring the situation during epidemic seasons and predictive mathematic models may aid the early detection of epidemic patterns. The objective of this study was to design a real-time spatial predictive model of ILI (Influenza Like Illness) incidence rate in Catalonia using one- and two-week forecasts. The available data sources used to select explanatory variables to include in the model were the statutory reporting disease system and the sentinel surveillance system in Catalonia for influenza incidence rates, the official climate service in Catalonia for meteorological data, laboratory data and Google Flu Trend. Time series for every explanatory variable with data from the last 4 seasons (from 2010–2011 to 2013–2014) was created. A pilot test was conducted during the 2014–2015 season to select the explanatory variables to be included in the model and the type of model to be applied. During the 2015–2016 season a real-time model was applied weekly, obtaining the intensity level and predicted incidence rates with 95% confidence levels one and two weeks away for each health region. At the end of the season, the confidence interval success rate (CISR) and intensity level success rate (ILSR) were analysed. For the 2015–2016 season a CISR of 85.3% at one week and 87.1% at two weeks and an ILSR of 82.9% and 82% were observed, respectively. The model described is a useful tool although it is hard to evaluate due to uncertainty. The accuracy of prediction at one and two weeks was above 80% globally, but was lower during the peak epidemic period. In order to improve the predictive power, new explanatory variables should be included.},

Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate data on oseltamivir dispensing extracted from medical claims records as an indicator of influenza activity in the United States for the 2010-11 through 2014-15 influenza seasons. Methods We used Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) medical claims data to evaluate the weekly number of therapeutic oseltamivir prescriptions dispensed following a rapid influenza diagnostic test among beneficiaries 65 years old and older as an indicator of influenza timing and intensity. We compared the temporal changes in this indicator to changes in the proportion of influenza-like illnesses among outpatient visits in the US Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) by administrative regions defined by the US Department of Health and Human Services. Using the moving epidemic method, we determined intensity thresholds and categorized the severity of seasons for both CMS and ILINet data. Results Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services oseltamivir data and ILINet data were strongly correlated by administrative region (median Spearman's ρ = 0.78; interquartile range = 0.73-0.80).

  abstract = {Using Medicare claims data on prescriptions of oseltamivir dispensed to people 65 years old and older, we present a descriptive analysis of patterns of influenza activity in the United States for 579 core-based statistical areas (CBSAs) from the 2010–2011 through the 2015–2016 influenza seasons. During this time, 1,010,819 beneficiaries received a prescription of oseltamivir, ranging from 45,888 in 2011–2012 to 380,745 in 2014–2015. For each season, the peak weekly number of prescriptions correlated with the total number of prescriptions (Pearson’s r ≥ 0.88). The variance in peak timing decreased with increasing severity (p < 0.0001). Among these 579 CBSAs, neither peak timing, nor relative timing, nor severity of influenza seasons showed evidence of spatial autocorrelation (0.02 ≤ Moran’s I ≤ 0.23). After aggregating data to the state level, agreement between the seasonal severity at the CBSA level and the state level was fair (median Cohen’s weighted κ = 0.32, interquartile range = 0.26–0.39). Based on seasonal severity, relative timing, and geographic place, we used hierarchical agglomerative clustering to join CBSAs into influenza zones for each season. Seasonal maps of influenza zones showed no obvious patterns that might assist in predicting influenza zones for future seasons. Because of the large number of prescriptions, these data may be especially useful for characterizing influenza activity and geographic distribution during low severity seasons, when other data sources measuring influenza activity are likely to be sparse.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background In Slovenia, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) surveillance is based on national laboratory data. The weeks with more than 10\% of samples tested positive compose RSV epidemic season. The use of real-time multiplex PCR, which identifies other respiratory pathogens in parallel with RSV, caused more testing but the percentage of RSV positives lowered. The 10\% threshold was reached with delay, which raised concern about its suitability for defining RSV seasonality. Methods To describe the seasonality of RSV, the onset, offset and duration of the RSV epidemic season across 10 years (from week 40, 2008/2009 to week 39, 2017/2018), four calculative methods were deployed including moving epidemic method, MEM, and epidemiological parameters were compared. Results In 10 years, 10 969 (12\%) out of 90 264 samples tested positive for RSV. The number of tested samples increased remarkably from the first to last season with a drop in the percentage of positive samples from 23\% to 10\%. The onset of RSV epidemic varied considerably regardless of the calculative method used (from 10 to 13 weeks). The unevenness in the RSV epidemic season end was also observed. The average duration of RSV epidemic season was the shortest when moving epidemic method has been used (15.7 weeks) and longest with ≥3\% method (22.9 weeks). Conclusion The ≥3\% calculative method could be used as an early warning of the RSV season. However, ≥7\% calculative method was found to be reliable enough to define the epidemiological parameters of an ongoing season and to support public health response. The potential of the moving epidemic method should be further explored.},

In 2008, an influenza surveillance system was set up in eight sentinel sites. This study describes the epidemiology of influenza virus using a 10-year surveillance data from 2008 to 2017. Nasopharyngeal/throat swabs were collected from patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) along with relevant epidemiological information. The samples were tested using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the detection and characterization of influenza viruses. A total of 17 209 samples were tested for influenza, out of which 3552 (20.6\%) were positive; 2151/11 239 (19.1\%) were patients with ILI, whereas 1401/5970 (23.5\%) were patients with SARI. Influenza A/H1N1pdm09 was the predominant strain with 40.6\% (n = 1442) followed by influenza B (936, 26.4\%). Influenza A/H1N1pdm09 was predominant among the children (5-14 years) and adults (15-64 years). Influenza B strain was predominantly found in the elderly age group (≥ 65 years) accounting for 48\% of cases followed by children (2-4 years) accounting for 37\% of cases. This 10-year surveillance data provides evidence of influenza activity in the country throughout the year with seasonal winter peaks. The results could be used to strengthen the epidemic preparedness and response plan.},

  abstract  = {Influenza is associated with severe illness, death, and economic burden. Sentinel surveillance systems have a central role in the community since they support public health interventions. This study aimed to describe and compare the influenza-coded primary care consultations with the reference index of influenza activity used in Portugal, General Practitioners Sentinel Network, from 2012 to 2017. An ecological time-series study was conducted using weekly R80-coded primary care consultations (according to the International Classification of Primary Care-2), weekly influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence rates from the General Practitioners Sentinel Network and Goldstein Index (GI). Good accordance between these three indicators was observed in the characterization of influenza activity regarding to start and length of the epidemic period, intensity of influenza activity, and influenza peak. A high correlation (>0.75) was obtained between weekly ILI incidence rates and weekly number of R80-coded primary care consultations during all five studied seasons. In 3 out of 5 seasons this correlation increased when weekly ILI incidence rates were multiplied for the percentage of influenza positive cases. A cross-correlation between weekly ILI incidence rates and the weekly number of R80-coded primary care consultations revealed that there was no lag between the rate curves of influenza incidence and the number of consultations in the 2012/13 and 2013/14 seasons. In the last three seasons, the weekly influenza incidence rates detected the influenza epidemic peak for about a week earlier. In the last season, the GI anticipated the detection of influenza peak for about a two-week period. Sentinel networks are fundamental elements in influenza surveillance that integrate clinical and virological data but often lack representativeness and are not able to provide regional and age groups estimates. Given the good correlation between weekly ILI incidence rate and weekly number of R80 consultations, primary care consultation coding system may be used to complement influenza surveillance data, namely, to monitor regional influenza activity. In the future, it would be interesting to analyse concurrent implementation of both surveillance systems with the integration of all available information.},

  abstract = {Background Healthcare professionals (HCPs) search medical information during their clinical work using Internet sources. In Finland, Physician's Databases (PD) serve as an Internet medical portal aimed at HCPs. Influenza epidemics appear seasonal outbreaks causing public health concern. Oseltamivir can be used to treat influenza. Little is known about HCPs’ queries on oseltamivir and influenza from dedicated online medical portals and whether queries could be used as an additional source of information for disease surveillance when detecting influenza epidemics. Methods We compared HCPs’ queries on oseltamivir and influenza from PD to influenza diagnoses from the primary healthcare register in Finland 2011-2016. The Moving Epidemic Method (MEM) calculated the starts of influenza epidemics. Laboratory reports of influenza A and influenza B were assessed. Paired differences compared queries, diagnoses, and laboratory reports by using starting weeks. Kendall's correlation test assessed the season-to-season similarity. Results We found that PD and the primary healthcare register showed visually similar patterns annually. Paired differences in the mean showed that influenza epidemics based on queries on oseltamivir started earlier than epidemics based on diagnoses by −0.80 weeks (95\% CI: −1.0, 0.0) with high correlation (τ = 0.943). Queries on influenza preceded queries on oseltamivir by −0.80 weeks (95\% CI: −1.2, 0.0) and diagnoses by −1.60 weeks (95\% CI: −1.8, −1.0). Conclusions HCPs’ queries on oseltamivir and influenza from Internet medical databases correlated with register diagnoses of influenza. Therefore, they should be considered as a supplementary source of information for disease surveillance when detecting influenza epidemics.},

  abstract = {Background: Several statistical methods of variable complexity have been developed to establish thresholds for influenza activity that may be used to inform public health guidance. We compared the results of two methods and explored how they worked to characterize the 2017-2018 season.Methods: Historical data from the 2005/2006 to 2016/2017 seasons were provided by a network of 412 primary health centers in charge of influenza like illness (ILI) sentinel surveillance. We used the WHO averages and the moving epidemic method (MEM) to evaluate the proportion of ILI visits among all outpatient consultations (ILI%) as a proxy for influenza activity. We also used the MEM method to evaluate three seasons of composite data (ILI% multiplied by percent of ILI with laboratory-confirmed influenza) as recommended by WHO. Results: The WHO method estimated the seasonal ILI% threshold at 0.9%. The annual epidemic period began on average at week 46 and lasted an average of 18 weeks. The MEM model estimated the epidemic threshold (corresponding to the WHO seasonal threshold) at 1.5% of ILI visits among all outpatient consultations. The annual epidemic period began on week 49 and lasted on average 14 weeks. Intensity thresholds were similar using both methods. When using the composite measure, the MEM method showed a clearer estimate of the beginning of the influenza epidemic, which was coincident with a sharp increase in confirmed ILI cases. Conclusions: We found that the threshold methodology presented in the WHO manual is simple to implement and easy to adopt for use by the Moroccan influenza surveillance system. The MEM method is more statistically sophisticated and may allow a better detection of the start of seasonal epidemics. Incorporation of virologic data into the composite parameter as recommended by WHO has the potential to increase the accuracy of seasonal threshold estimation.},

Often comparisons with baseline data involve various squared error and correlation metrics. While useful, these overlook a variety of other factors important to public health bodies considering the adoption of such methods. In this paper, a proposed surveillance system that incorporates models based on recent research efforts is evaluated in terms of its added value for influenza surveillance at Public Health England. The system comprises of two supervised learning approaches trained on influenza-like illness (ILI) rates provided by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and produces ILI estimates using Twitter posts or Google search queries. RCGP ILI rates for different age groups and laboratory confirmed cases by influenza type are used to evaluate the models with a particular focus on predicting the onset, overall intensity, peak activity and duration of the 2015/16 influenza season. We show that the Twitter-based models perform poorly and hypothesise that this is mostly due to the sparsity of the data available and a limited training period. Conversely, the Google-based model provides accurate estimates with timeliness of approximately one week and has the potential to complement current surveillance systems.},

  abstract  = {IntroductionHealth authorities find thresholds useful to gauge the start and severity of influenza seasons. We explored a method for deriving thresholds proposed in an influenza surveillance manual published by the World Health Organization (WHO).   MethodsFor 2002-2011, we analysed two routine influenza-like-illness (ILI) datasets, general practice sentinel surveillance and a locum medical service sentinel surveillance, plus laboratory data and hospital admissions for influenza. For each sentinel dataset, we created two composite variables from the product of weekly ILI data and the relevant laboratory data, indicating the proportion of tested specimens that were positive. For all datasets, including the composite datasets, we aligned data on the median week of peak influenza or ILI activity and assigned three threshold levels: seasonal threshold, determined by inspection; and two intensity thresholds termed average and alert thresholds, determined by calculations of means, medians, confidence intervals (CI) and percentiles. From the thresholds, we compared the seasonal onset, end and intensity across all datasets from 2002-2011. Correlation between datasets was assessed using the mean correlation coefficient.   ResultsThe median week of peak activity was week 34 for all datasets, except hospital data (week 35). Means and medians were comparable and the 90% upper CIs were similar to the 95th percentiles. Comparison of thresholds revealed variations in defining the start of a season but good agreement in describing the end and intensity of influenza seasons, except in hospital admissions data after the pandemic year of 2009. The composite variables improved the agreements between the ILI and other datasets. Datasets were well correlated, with mean correlation coefficients of >0.75 for a range of combinations.   ConclusionsThresholds for influenza surveillance are easily derived from historical surveillance and laboratory data using the approach proposed by WHO. Use of composite variables is helpful for describing influenza season characteristics.},

  abstract = {In England and Wales, a large-scale multiple statistical surveillance system for infectious disease outbreaks has been in operation for nearly two decades. This system uses a robust quasi-Poisson regression algorithm to identify aberrances in weekly counts of isolates reported to the Health Protection Agency. In this paper, we review the performance of the system with a view to reducing the number of false reports, while retaining good power to detect genuine outbreaks. We undertook extensive simulations to evaluate the existing system in a range of contrasting scenarios. We suggest several improvements relating to the treatment of trends, seasonality, re-weighting of baselines and error structure. We validate these results by running the existing and proposed new systems in parallel on real data. We find that the new system greatly reduces the number of alarms while maintaining good overall performance and in some instances increasing the sensitivity.

Generalizable seasonal patterns of respiratory virus transmission may estimate the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 or other emerging pathogens.To describe the annual and biennial variation in respiratory virus seasonality in a northern climate.This cohort study is an epidemiological assessment using population-based surveillance of patients with medically attended respiratory tract infection from 2005 through 2017 in Alberta, Canada. Incident cases of respiratory virus infection and infant respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalizations in Alberta were extracted from the Data Integration for Alberta Laboratories platform and Alberta Health Services Discharge Abstract Database, respectively. A deterministic susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible mathematical model with seasonal forcing function was fitted to the data for each virus. The possible future seasonal course of SARS-CoV-2 in northern latitudes was modeled on the basis of these observations. The analysis was conducted between December 15, 2020, and February 10, 2021.Seasonal respiratory pathogens.Incidence (temporal pattern) of respiratory virus infections and RSV hospitalizations.A total of 37 719 incident infections with RSV, human metapneumovirus, or human coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 among 35 375 patients (18 069 [51.1\\%] male; median [interquartile range], 1.29 [0.42-12.2] years) were documented. A susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible model mirrored the epidemiological data, including a striking biennial variation with alternating severe and mild winter peaks. Qualitative description of the model and numerical simulations showed that strong seasonal contact rate and temporary immunity lasting 6 to 12 months were sufficient to explain biennial seasonality in these various respiratory viruses. The seasonality of 10 212 hospitalizations among children younger than 5 years with RSV was also explored. The median (interquartile range) rate of hospitalizations per 1000 live births was 18.6 (17.6-19.9) and 11.0 (10.4-11.7) in alternating even (severe) and odd (less-severe) seasons, respectively (P = .001). The hazard of admission was higher for children born in severe (even) seasons compared with those born in less-severe (odd) seasons (hazard ratio, 1.68; 95\\% CI, 1.61-1.75; P \\&lt; .001).In this modeling study of respiratory viruses in Alberta, Canada, the seasonality followed a pattern estimated by simple mathematical models, which may be informative for anticipating future waves of pandemic SARS-CoV-2.}},

Methods We adapted the Moving Epidemic Method to all-cause mortality data from the United States to assess the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic across age groups and all 50 states. By comparing all-cause mortality during the pandemic with intensity thresholds derived from recent, historical all-cause mortality, we categorized each week from March to December 2020 as either low severity, moderate severity, high severity, or very high severity. Results Nationally for all ages combined, all-cause mortality was in the very high severity category for 9 weeks. Among people 18 to 49 years of age, there were 29 weeks of consecutive very high severity mortality. Forty-seven states, the District of Columbia, and New York City each experienced at least 1 week of very high severity mortality for all ages combined. Conclusions These periods of very high severity of mortality during March through December 2020 are likely directly or indirectly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. This method for standardized comparison of severity over time across different geographies and demographic groups provides valuable information to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify specific locations or subgroups for deeper investigations into differences in severity.},

  abstract       = {Background: School-aged children were reported to act as the main transmitter during influenza epidemic seasons. It is vital to set up an early detection method to help with the vaccination program in such a high-risk population. However, most relative studies only focused on the general population. Our study aims to describe the influenza epidemiology characteristics in Hubei Province and to introduce the moving epidemic method to establish the epidemic thresholds for age-specific groups. Methods: We divided the whole population into pre-school, school-aged and adult groups. The virology data from 2010/2011 to 2017/2018 were applied to the moving epidemic method to establish the epidemic thresholds for the general population and age-specific groups for the detection of influenza in 2018/2019. The performances of the model were compared by the cross-validation process. Results: The epidemic threshold for school-aged children in the 2018/2019 season was 15.42%. The epidemic thresholds for influenza A virus subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 and influenza B were determined as 5.68%, 6.12% and 10.48%, respectively. The median start weeks of the school-aged children were similar to the general population. The cross-validation process showed that the sensitivity of the model established with school-aged children was higher than those established with the other age groups in total influenza, H1N1 and influenza B, while it was only lower than the general population group in H3N2. Conclusions: This study proved the feasibility of applying the moving epidemic method in Hubei Province. Additional influenza surveillance and vaccination strategies should be well-organized for school-aged children to reduce the disease burden of influenza in China.},

  abstract       = {Influenza circulation was substantially reduced after March 2020 in the European region and globally due to the wide introduction of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against COVID-19. The virus, however, has been actively circulating in natural reservoirs. In summer 2021, NPIs were loosened in Russia, and influenza activity resumed shortly thereafter. Here, we summarize the epidemiological and virological data on the influenza epidemic in Russia in 2021&ndash;2022 obtained by the two National Influenza Centers. We demonstrate that the commonly used baseline for acute respiratory infection (ARI) is no longer sufficiently sensitive and BL for ILI incidence was more specific for early recognition of the epidemic. We also present the results of PCR detection of influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses as well as antigenic and genetic analysis of influenza viruses. Influenza A(H3N2) prevailed this season with influenza B being detected at low levels at the end of the epidemic. The majority of A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically and genetically homogenous and belonged to the clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2 of the vaccine strain A/Darwin/9/2021 for the season 2022&ndash;2023. All influenza B viruses belonged to the Victoria lineage and were similar to the influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 virus.

  abstract  = {Introduction Mauritius introduced Acute respiratory infection (ARI) syndromic surveillance in 2007. The Moving Epidemic Method (MEM) and the World Health Organization Average Curve Method (WHO ACM) have been used widely in several countries to establish thresholds to determine the seasonality of acute respiratory infections. This study aimed to evaluate the appropriateness of these tools for ARI syndromic surveillance in Mauritius, where two or more waves are observed.   Method The proportion of attendance due to acute respiratory infections was identified as the transmissibility indicator to describe seasonality using the Moving Epidemic Method and the WHO Average Curve Method. The proportion was obtained from weekly outpatient data between 2012 and 2018 collected from the sentinel acute respiratory infections surveillance. A cross-validation analysis was carried out. The resulting indicators of the goodness of fit model were used to assess the robustness of the seasonal/epidemic threshold of both the Moving Epidemic Method and WHO Average Curve Method. Additionally, a comparative analysis examined the integrity of the thresholds without the year 2017.   Result The cross-validation analysis demonstrated no statistically significant differences between the means scores of the indicators when comparing the two waves/seasons curves of WHO ACM and MEM. The only exception being that the Wilcoxon sign rank test strongly supported that the specificity mean score of the two waves/seasons curve for WHO ACM outweighed that of its corresponding wave model for the MEM (P = 0.002). The comparative analysis with 2017 data showed the value of the epidemic threshold remained the same regardless of the methods and the number of seasonal waves.   Conclusion The two waves models of the Moving Epidemic Method and WHO Average Curve Method could be deployed for acute respiratory infection syndromic surveillance in Mauritius, considering that two or more activity peaks are observed in a season.},

Understanding when and where an outbreak may occur is vital for public health planning and response. We usually rely on well-functioning surveillance systems to monitor epidemic outbreaks. However, not all countries have a well-functioning surveillance system in place, or at least not for the pathogen in question. We utilized Google Trends search results for RSV-related keywords to identify outbreaks. We evaluated the strength of the Pearson correlation coefficient between clinical surveillance data and online search data and applied the Moving Epidemic Method (MEM) to identify country-specific epidemic thresholds. Additionally, we established pseudo-RSV surveillance systems, enabling internal stakeholders to obtain insights on the speed and risk of any emerging RSV outbreaks in countries with imprecise disease surveillance systems but with Google Trends data. Strong correlations between RSV clinical surveillance data and Google Trends search results from several countries were observed. In monitoring an upcoming RSV outbreak with MEM, data collected from both systems yielded similar estimates of country-specific epidemic thresholds, starting time, and duration. We demonstrate in this study the potential of monitoring disease outbreaks in real time and complement classical disease surveillance systems by leveraging online search data.},

The system based on the World Health Organization (WHO) Pandemic Influenza Severity Assessment (PISA) project included a panel of surveillance parameters for the following indicators: transmissibility, impact and disease severity. Age-specific thresholds were established for each parameter and data visualised using heat maps. The findings from the first pandemic wave in Ireland have shown that the WHO PISA system can be adapted for COVID-19, providing a standardised tool for early warning and monitoring pandemic severity.},

The in-control mean is assumed to be time-varying and linear on the log-scale with intercept and seasonal components. If a shift in the intercept occurs the system goes out-of-control. Using the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) statistic a monitoring scheme is formulated to detect on-line whether a shift in the intercept occurred. In the case of Poisson the necessary quantities of the GLR detector can be efficiently computed by recursive formulas. Extensions to more general alternatives e.g. containing an auto-regressive epidemic component are discussed. Using Monte Carlo simulations run-length properties of the proposed schemes are investigated and the Poisson scheme is compared to existing methods. The practicability of the charts is demonstrated by applying them to the observed number of salmonella hadar cases in Germany 2001–2006.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background  A wide range of methods have been used for estimating influenza-associated deaths in temperate countries. Direct comparisons of estimates produced by using different models with US mortality data have not been published. Objective  Compare estimates of US influenza-associated deaths made by using four models and summarize strengths and weaknesses of each model. Methods  US mortality data from the 1972–1973 through 2002–2003 respiratory seasons and World Health Organization influenza surveillance data were used to estimate influenza-associated respiratory and circulatory deaths. Four models were used: (i) rate-difference (using peri-season or summer-season baselines), (ii) Serfling least squares cyclical regression, (iii) Serfling–Poisson regression, (iv) and autoregressive integrated moving average models. Results  Annual estimates of influenza-associated deaths made using each model were similar and positively correlated, except for estimates from the summer-season rate-difference model, which were consistently higher. From the 1976/1977 through the 2002/2003 seasons the, the Poisson regression models estimated that an annual average of 25 470 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 19 781–31 159] influenza-associated respiratory and circulatory deaths [9·9 deaths per 100 000 (95\% CI 7·9–11·9)], while peri-season rate-difference models using a 15\% threshold estimated an annual average of 22 454 (95\% CI 16 189–28 719) deaths [8·6 deaths per 100 000 (95\% CI 6·4–10·9)]. Conclusions  Estimates of influenza-associated mortality were of similar magnitude. Poisson regression models permit the estimation of deaths associated with influenza A and B, but require robust viral surveillance data. By contrast, simple peri-season rate-difference models may prove useful for estimating mortality in countries with sparse viral surveillance data or complex influenza seasonality.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background We report our experience in evaluating the severity of local influenza epidemics using the World Health Organization Pandemic Influenza Severity Assessment framework. Methods We assessed the severity of influenza by monitoring indicators of influenza transmissibility, seriousness of disease and impact on healthcare resource utilisation. Indicators were described by various parameters collected weekly from eight government hospitals, 20 government and 30 private primary care clinics, and the national public health laboratory. Transmissibility and seriousness of disease indicators were each represented by multiple parameters, and alert thresholds were set at the 70th and 90th percentile of a parameter's past 2-year surveillance data. We derived a collective measure for each indicator using the average percentile rank of the related parameters. Alert thresholds for the single impact parameter were set at predefined values and evaluated for its sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value. Results For the transmissibility and seriousness of disease parameters, calculation of the percentile rank was simple and independent of a parameter's underlying distribution. For the impact parameter, predefined alert thresholds had high sensitivity and specificity (>80\%) but low positive predictive value (15\%-30\%). Assessment scales were used to qualitatively classify the activity of an indicator as low, moderate or high together with a confidence level. Conclusion We applied different methods for threshold setting depending on the attributes of each parameter and indicator. For indicators represented by multiple parameters, an aggregated assessment of the indicator's level of activity and confidence level of the assessment was needed for effective reporting.},
